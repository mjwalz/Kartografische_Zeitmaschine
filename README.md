### Editoral Department

Thanks to Django the admin interface is ready to use and can be extended as needed for the editoral department and verification of the data.

### User Roles and Permissions

The platform will support a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage content creation, data verification, and public access. The following roles are defined:

- **Administrator**:
  - Full control over the system, including user management, system settings, and all content.
  - Can assign roles to other users.
  - Can delete any storymap or dataset.

- **Editor / Author**:
  - Can create, edit, and manage their own storymaps.
  - Can use any data from the "Verified Data Pool" in their storymaps.
  - Can submit their storymaps for editorial review and publication.

- **Data Specialist**:
  - Responsible for uploading, managing, and documenting datasets.
  - Can submit datasets for certification to be included in the "Verified Data Pool."
  - Cannot create or edit storymaps.

- **Public Viewer**:
  - The default role for all visitors.
  - Can browse and view all published storymaps.
  - Cannot access draft content, the editor, or the admin interface.

### Admin Panel & Data Workflow

The backend provides powerful interfaces for data management through the Django Admin Panel and direct QGIS integration. The following mockups illustrate these key, currently available workflows as examples.

**1. Django Admin Data Models**

The admin panel includes views for managing the core data models: `Layer`, `Feature`, and `GeoData`.

![Placeholder for Admin Data Models](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Admin+View%3A+GeoData%2C+Layer%2C+Feature+Models)
*Placeholder | Caption: Admin view showing the list displays for core data models.*

**2. REST Framework API View**

A browsable API endpoint, powered by Django REST Framework, is available for frontend integration.

![Placeholder for REST API View](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500.png?text=Django+REST+Framework+API+View)
*Placeholder | Caption: The browsable API view for the GeoData serializer.*

**3. QGIS Data Interaction**

Direct integration with QGIS allows for creating, editing, and managing geospatial data stored in PostGIS.

## Webmap Components

| Component | Property | Description | "Esri-like" Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basemap** | **Source** | The URL or service providing the base map tiles. | High-quality, visually neutral basemap (e.g., light gray canvas, satellite, topographic) that doesn't distract from your data. |
| | **Projection** | The coordinate system used (usually Web Mercator). | Consistent projection across all layers to ensure alignment. |
| **Layers** | **Source Data** | The geographic data to be displayed. | Clean, optimized data. Common formats: **GeoJSON** (for simplicity), **Vector Tiles (MVT)** (for performance with large datasets). |
| | **Visibility** | Whether the layer is currently visible or not. | Can be toggled on/off by the user via a layer list control. |
| | **Opacity** | The transparency level of the entire layer (0-1). | Used for blending layers or de-emphasizing less important data. |
| | **Zoom Range** | The zoom levels at which the layer is visible. | **Crucial for performance and clarity.** Show detailed layers only when zoomed in to avoid clutter. |
| **Feature Styling**| | | |
| â”œ **Points** | `icon-image` | A custom image or symbol to represent the point. | High-quality, meaningful SVG icons. |
| | `icon-size` | The size of the icon. | Can be driven by data (e.g., bigger icon for a bigger city). |
| | `text-field` | An attribute to display as a label next to the point. | Clear, legible font with a halo effect for readability against any background. |
| â”œ **Lines** | `line-color` | The color of the line. | Colors are often data-driven (e.g., red for highways, blue for rivers). |
| | `line-width` | The thickness of the line. | Can be used to show importance (e.g., thicker line for a major road). |
| | `line-dasharray`| Creates dashed or dotted lines. | Useful for representing proposed routes, boundaries, or different statuses. |
| â”œ **Polygons**| `fill-color` | The color of the area inside the polygon. | **Data-driven choropleth maps** are a hallmark (e.g., coloring states by population). |
| | `fill-opacity` | The transparency of the fill color. | Allows underlying features or basemaps to be visible. |
| | `outline-color`| The color of the polygon's border. | A subtle, clean border to clearly define the shape. |
| **Popups** | **Content** | The HTML content to display when a feature is clicked. | Rich content: not just text, but **images, charts, and links**. Use attribute placeholders like `{name}` or `{population}`. |
| | **Trigger** | The event that opens the popup. | Typically `on-click`. Hover-triggered tooltips are also common for quick info. |
| | **Styling** | CSS to control the look of the popup container. | Clean, modern design that matches the overall UI of the application. |
| **Interactivity** | **Map Controls** | UI elements for navigation. | Standard controls: Zoom In/Out, Compass (Reset North), Geolocation (Find My Location), Scale Bar. |
| | **Legend** | A key that explains the map's symbols and colors. | **Essential for complex maps.** A legend makes your map readable and professional. |
| | **Animations** | Smooth transitions when the map view changes. | Use of `flyTo` or `easeTo` animations instead of instantly jumping to a new location. |

### Summary for an "Esri-like" Feel:
To get that professional, polished look similar to Esri's StoryMaps, the key is to move beyond just displaying data and focus on **data-driven visualization** and a **rich user experience**.

1.  **Performance is Key**: Use **Vector Tiles** for large datasets. Nothing looks less professional than a slow, laggy map.
2.  **Styling with Purpose**: Don't just pick random colors. Use color and size to tell a story about your data. Implement a **legend** so users can understand it.
3.  **Rich, Interactive Popups**: Go beyond plain text. Embed images, charts, and formatted text to provide deep context when a user interacts with a feature.
4.  **Smoothness and Polish**: Use animated transitions (`flyTo`) and control layer visibility based on zoom levels to create a seamless, uncluttered experience.

## Storymap Components

| Component | Property | Description | "Esri-like" Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Story (Overall)** | `Title` / `Cover` | The main title, subtitle, and cover image/video. | A compelling, high-impact opening that grabs the reader's attention. |
| | `Theme` | Overall visual design (fonts, colors, layout styles). | A consistent, professional, and readable design that enhances the story's mood. |
| **Story Items (Chapters/Slides)** | `Sequence` | The linear or non-linear order of the story's sections. | A logical and engaging narrative flow. |
| | `Layout` | How content is arranged on the screen for each item. | Varied layouts (e.g., floating panel over map, side-by-side, full-screen text) to maintain visual interest. |
| **Content Blocks** | `Type` | The kind of content within a story item. | A rich mix of **Text**, **Images**, **Video**, and embedded content to create a multimedia experience. |
| | `Content` | The actual text, media URLs, or embed codes. | High-quality, optimized media. Well-written, concise prose. |
| **Map Interaction (Scrollytelling)** | `Map View` | The specific map `center`, `zoom`, `pitch`, and `bearing` for a story item. | The map view must perfectly frame the geographic context for that part of the story. |
| | `Active Layers`| Defines which map layers are visible for a specific story item. | Only show layers relevant to the current narrative point to reduce clutter and focus attention. |
| | `Transition` | The animation used to move between map views as the user scrolls. | Smooth `flyTo` or `easeTo` animations that guide the user's focus, creating a cinematic feel. |
| | `Highlighting` | Programmatically emphasizing specific features on the map. | Draws the user's eye to the exact feature being discussed in the text, often by changing its style or adding a marker. |
| **UI/UX** | `Navigation` | How users move through the story. | Clear UI for navigation: a progress bar, chapter headings, and next/previous controls. |
| | `Credits` | A dedicated section to credit data sources, authors, etc. | Proper attribution is crucial for professional and ethical storytelling. |
| | `Sharing` | Options to share the storymap on social media or get a direct link. | Easy sharing encourages wider distribution and impact. |


## Modelling

The models are defined in the `BE` repository as part of the Django project.

### The models are structured as follows:

- `Layer`
- `GeoData`
- `Feature`
- `Webmap`
- `StorymapItem`
- `Storymap`
- `User`
- `Profile`
- `Tag`
- `Group`
- `Category`
- (`IndexContent` / `PageContent` etc.)


### ER Diagram
The ER diagram displays the relationships between the models in the Kartographische_Zeitmaschine. It shows how users are associated with profiles, storymaps, and webmaps. It also shows how storymaps are composed of storymap items, and how webmaps are linked to layers and geodata.

## Analysis of Existing Map-Based Projects

The following projects serve as technical or conceptual references. While they are powerful data visualization tools, they generally lack the guided, narrative-driven approach of a storymap.

### <https://martinbrake.de/timelines/autobahn>

This page presents an interactive "timemap" visualizing the historical development of the German Autobahn network.

- **Functionality**: It uses a timeline slider to show the growth of the road network over different years. As the user moves the slider, corresponding road sections are added to the map.
- **Interactivity**: The map is the central element, showing the geographic changes directly. It's a data-driven exploration rather than a guided narrative.
- **Technology**: Built with Leaflet.js for mapping and uses `perfect-scrollbar` for the timeline navigation.
